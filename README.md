Web Stack: MERN

The goal of this project is to create a full stack web application that serves as a marketplace for students at Cal Poly Pomona to resell items like books, lab coats, furniture, laptops, etc. Students should first be asked to create an account at the login page with their email address, password,name, and profile photo. Once they login, they should be at the store page, which is where the items are organized 3 per row. However, the tabs/buttons for the pages will be on the left of the application that include: Home, Blog. To start off with home, there should be a button at the top right where they can hit upload, and a pop up box will allow the user to upload various attributes of their item like: name, price, description, photo, and they can choose a category among the ones listed in a drop-down menu.  Once they post, it should be at the very top(recent postings must be at the top). Also on the home page is a search box that will allow users to search for a specific item, and a category filter box. For the blog page, it should be similar where users would instead be able to post questions that they have, and other users should be able to answer them. To elaborate, it could be used for users who want to ask if anyone is planning on selling a specific item or just other general inquiries. There should be an option to reply to a specific user, and there will be a filter box where you can filter out the types of questions. Overall, the application will require created users, and there should be usernames displayed on every post. This will also allow the future plans of this application to be carried out so there is more of a community feel to it like other social media websites we see.
